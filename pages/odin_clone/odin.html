                            Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an 
                            intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. 
                            This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it 
                            on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>

                        <p>The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since itâ€™s inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others learn enough programming to work on their own personal projects.</p>
                        <p>Founded in 2013 by Erik Trautman, The Odin Project is now sponsored by Thinkful, a new type of technology school that provides 1-on-1 learning through its network of industry experts, hiring partners, and online platform to deliver a structured and flexible education. The Odin Project is maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteers, many of whom learned to code with us.</p>

                    <h2>Rob Pando, Fullstack Developer</h2>
                    <p>TOP was a perfect match for my learning style. Not walking me through an entire project but actually forcing me to figure it out on my own, by pointing me in all the right directions in order to complete them. That helped me dig deeper into various important topics, which then gave me the necessary knowledge and confidence to start applying for jobs and landing that dream job. The community was part of it too, first getting help and then helping, it was a great way to learn and make it stick.</p>
                    <h2>Cody Loyd, Software Engineer</h2>
                    <p>Before I started the Odin Project I had literally ZERO programming experience. After almost exactly a year of working through the program, I was offered a job as a front end web developer. Odin taught me all the most crucial skills in webdev and gave me an incredibly strong foundation for branching out and learning other pieces of the web-dev puzzle along the way.</p>
                    <h2>Andrej DragojeviÄ‡, Full Stack Ruby on Rails Developer</h2>
                    <p>An incredible self-paced curriculum that consists of the best resources for learning programming on the web! It was an invaluable resource on my path to a becoming a software developer. Thanks to The Odin Project I was able to get a job half way through the curriculum, and the projects completed as part of the curriculum gave me an edge compared to other junior developers with no experience.</p>
